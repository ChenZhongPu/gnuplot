The online book can be read from [Gnuplot Port For Matplotlib](https://chenzhongpu.github.io/gnuplot/intro.html).

> In the Unix tradition, gnuplot is a simple tool, doing (mostly) one thing, and doing it very, very well.

In this book, I would like to *reinvent the wheels* by reintroducing the tutorial of [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). 

Matplotlib can be well integrated with other awesome libraries (e.g., `numpy` and `pandas`) in Python, so it is user-friendly for Python developers and researchers, especially in the domain of machine learning. On the other hand, many developers and researchers just want to *plot* and *visualize* their experimental results. To this end, a lightweight plot utility is in demand, and I think gnuplot is born to do so.

Last but not least, I am a newbie of gnuplot (starting to use it since April 2022), so some methods and practices in this book may not be idiomatic. If you have any suggestion, feel free to open an issue.
