# Introductory
These tutorials cover the basics of creating visualizations with gnuplot, as well as some best-practices in using the tool effectively.

Note that I will use the default terminal `qt` on my macOS, and those figures (`.svg`) are exported by gnuplot GUI windows by invoking the `load` command in gnuplot's prompt. As for the output in other formats (e.g., `eps`, `pdf` and `tex`), I will point out the *terminal* explicitly in the context.
