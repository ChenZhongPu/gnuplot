## 1. How to resize the figure
Command `set size ratio` can set the radio of height/width. However, this won't affect the size of figure itself, and it will only change the ratio the plotting area. To remove the extra space, we can use `size <width>, <height>` when `set terminal`.

For example, the following code is used to plot the time series data like [Plotting dates and strings](../ch1/basic_usage.html#plotting-dates-and-strings):

```
set terminal qt size 1000,540
set size ratio 2.7/5
unset key
set xdata time
set timefmt "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:00"
set xtics format "%m-%d"
plot "../data/date.dat" u 1:3 w lines lw 1.5
```
