# Introduction
Nowadays, people may think [Gnuplot](http://gnuplot.info/) is an old, awkward graphing utility. *Pace* to those comments, I still enjoy the flexibility brought by `gnuplot`.

> In the Unix tradition, gnuplot is a simple tool, doing (mostly) one thing, and doing it very, very well.

In this book, I would like to *reinvent the wheels* by reintroducing the tutorial of [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). 

**Disclaimer**: I have to admit that Python is great, and `Matplotlib` is powerful. So this book is intended to serve as a reference for people who want to try something new.

Matplotlib can be well integrated with other awesome libraries (e.g., `numpy` and `pandas`) in Python, so it is user-friendly for Python developers and researchers, especially in the domain of machine learning. On the other hand, many developers and researchers just want to *plot* and *visualize* their experimental results. To this end, a lightweight plot utility is in demand, and I think gnuplot is born to do so.

Data and code of this book can be found in [GitHub](https://github.com/ChenZhongPu/gnuplot).
