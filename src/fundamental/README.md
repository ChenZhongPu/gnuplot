# Fundamentals of Data Visualization
In this chapter, I will replot all figures shown in [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/index.html).

> Tutorials for plotting software typically focus on how to achieve specific visual effects rather than explaining why certain choices are preferred and others not.

Also, I would also share my understandings when reading this book. Quoted from the author of Tikz, 

> The only mistakes in typography are things done in ignorance.

I think it also holds true in plotting.
